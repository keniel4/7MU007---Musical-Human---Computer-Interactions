# 7MU007---Musical-Human---Computer-Interactions

The idea behind this project is to create a childrenâ€™s musical learning-based game for ages 4-8. It is based around timing with the player having to play along to the sequence in time in order to progress onto the next level. Each level advances in complexity, thus engaging with the players listening skills, timing, and developing rhythm. It is a hardware/software game.
