Rhythm Finder

The idea behind this project is to create a childrenâ€™s musical learning-based game for ages 4-8. Its main focus being around timing, the player has to play along to the sequence in time in order to progress onto the next level. Each level advances in complexity, thus engaging with the players listening skills, timing, and the ability to maintain a rhythmic pattern. There are two components in which the user interacts with the game, this being the hardware and software. This document will detail all the required pieces of hardware and instruction to this specific build. It will also encompass a breakdown of the software to allow for users to recreate.
